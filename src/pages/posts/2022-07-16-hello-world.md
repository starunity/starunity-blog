```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

A "Hello, world!" program is generally a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, world!". A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. "Hello, world!" programs are often the first a student learns to write in a given language,[1] and they can also be used as a sanity check to ensure computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.
